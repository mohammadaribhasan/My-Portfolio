# My Portfolio Website 🌐

[Live Link](https://mohammadaribhasan.vercel.app/)

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project serves as an online presence where I highlight my professional experience, showcase selected projects, list technical skills, and provide a way for visitors to get in touch.

## 🚀 Overview

The site is built with **Next.js 14** using the App Router and TypeScript for type safety. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, and the layout is fully responsive across devices. Content is organized into components within the `src/app/component` directory, with sample data stored in `src/app/data`.

Key pages include:

- **Home/Hero** – a welcome section with a brief introduction.
- **About** – information about me and my background.
- **Projects** – a list of projects with details pulled from a data file.
- **Skills** – a visual display of technologies I use.
- **Contact** – form and contact details to reach me.

## 🛠️ Features

- Modern Next.js 14 App Router structure
- TypeScript throughout the codebase
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Modular React components for ease of reuse
- Static data files for projects and skills
- Snowfall animation component (see `Snowfall.tsx`)
